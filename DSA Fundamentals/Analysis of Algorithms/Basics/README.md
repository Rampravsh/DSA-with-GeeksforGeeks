# Basics of Analysis of Algorithms

This section covers the fundamental concepts of analyzing algorithms.

## What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a finite set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of inputs and produces a desired output.

## Why is Analysis of Algorithms Important?

Algorithm analysis helps us determine the efficiency of an algorithm. It's crucial for a few reasons:

*   **Performance:** To predict the performance of an algorithm and compare it with others.
*   **Optimization:** To identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
*   **Scalability:** To understand how an algorithm will perform as the input size grows.

## Criteria for Analyzing Algorithms

We typically analyze algorithms based on two main criteria:

1.  **Time Complexity:** The amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size.
2.  **Space Complexity:** The amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size.

## Rate of Growth

The rate of growth of a function describes how fast the function's output grows as the input grows. In algorithm analysis, we are interested in the rate of growth of the time or space complexity.

## Asymptotic Notations

To represent the rate of growth, we use asymptotic notations. These notations provide a way to describe the performance of an algorithm in a formal and abstract way. The most common notations are:

*   **Big-O Notation (O):** Describes the upper bound (worst-case scenario).
*   **Omega Notation (Ω):** Describes the lower bound (best-case scenario).
*   **Theta Notation (Θ):** Describes the tight bound (average-case scenario).
